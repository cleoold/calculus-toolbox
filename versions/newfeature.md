### Curve length approximation
This feature works with the same principle as another `integral` does. It will also partition the interval bounded by x=a and x=b and sum the lengths of each line segment by Pythagorean theorem. It is a regular integral computation, but solves more specific questions. The process would be described as

The following process shows the length of half an arc of radius 1.

An error term is not omitted by default; they are negligible still.

### Extended Euclidean Algorithm
This feature is under `additional` menu. It helps users to find the GCD of two given integers and their coefficients.
